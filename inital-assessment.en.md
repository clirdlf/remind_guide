Prioritizing which collections to digitize can be a daunting task. The good news is that priorities will vary from organization to organization, depending on unique goals, resources, and needs. However, there are several essential factors to consider as you decide what to digitize.

## Current Organization and Intellectual Control of Materials

Digitization efforts should start with collections that your organization has intellectual control over. This ensures that you have the necessary permissions and rights to make digital copies of the materials. Consider collections that are:

* Owned or held in trust by your organization
* Under license or agreement, allowing for digitization
* In the public domain or have expired copyrights

## Condition and Housing

Collections in poor condition may require significant conservation efforts before they can be safely digitized. Consider prioritizing collections that are:

* Well-preserved and in good condition
* Stably housed and stored to prevent damage or deterioration

## Rarity/Uniqueness of Materials

Digitize unique or rare materials that have high research value, such as:

* One-of-a-kind artifacts or documents
* Rare books, manuscripts, or other printed materials
* Unique cultural or historical objects

## Use Cases/Needs for Content to Support New Exploration

Consider digitizing collections that will support new exploration, research, or engagement initiatives, such as:

* Collections related to emerging themes or topics of interest
* Materials that will enhance online exhibitions, educational resources, or community outreach programs
* Collections that can be used to develop innovative digital tools or platforms

## Format of Materials

Prioritize digitizing collections in formats that are easily accessible and usable, such as:

* Digital photographs or scans of printed materials
* Born-digital files (e.g., emails, social media posts)
* Audio or video recordings that can be made available online

## Questions to ask

* How unique are the materials? 
* Are other copies or versions of the artifacts already available online? 
* Why will people care about this collection? Will digital copies of the materials be genuinely useful to specific communities you wish to reach, or is the encounter with the physical artifact more important? 
* How will people use the digital copies? Are there related materials online that could complement the artifacts you wish to digitize? 
* How are the materials organized and described currently? 
* Would it be better to inventory or catalog the collection first before deciding to digitize? 
* What formats are included in the collection?

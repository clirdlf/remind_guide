## Introduction

Climate change has reached a critical juncture. Rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and unpredictable natural disasters are now the norm, with devastating consequences for our planet. Sea levels continue to rise, forests are disappearing at an alarming rate, and ecosystems are collapsing under the weight of human activity. The scientific consensus is clear: severe climate disruption is underway, and it will worsen unless we take drastic action.

As the climate crisis deepens, so too does the threat to our cultural knowledge. Most of the worldâ€™s irreplaceable artifacts, monuments, and historical sites are vulnerable to damage or loss due to rising temperatures, floods, droughts, and other extreme weather events. This includes not only tangible works of art and human expression but also more ephemeral culture such as language, ritual, performance, and personal memory. These intangible aspects of our cultural heritage are just as precious and fragile as the physical artifacts we cherish.

When we lose our cultural knowledge, we limit our response to this crisis in profound ways. We forget the lessons of history, lose touch with our traditions, and struggle to innovate in a rapidly changing world. The consequences are tragic: communities disintegrate, social cohesion is lost, and our collective capacity to respond to this crisis is severely diminished.

Recovering, safeguarding, and reusing cultural knowledge requires a global community of effort. We must come together as individuals, communities, and nations to share our knowledge, resources, and expertise. Technology can play a critical role in this process, enabling us to connect with each other, access information, and preserve our cultural heritage for future generations.

Long-term sustainability of cultural knowledge requires a living, behavioral conception of infrastructure that engages multiple generations. We must design systems, institutions, and practices that are responsive to the needs of today while also anticipating the challenges of tomorrow. This means involving young people in the preservation process, ensuring that our cultural heritage is relevant and meaningful to them, and providing opportunities for intergenerational learning and collaboration.

### The Field Guide: A Blueprint for Action

This Field Guide outlines how we can work together to safeguard and reuse cultural knowledge under threat from climate change. It provides a practical framework for action, drawing on the latest research, best practices, and innovative solutions. By following this guide, we can build a global community of effort that is committed to preserving our collective heritage for future generations.

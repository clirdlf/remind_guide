While making your digital collections available online is an essential step, preserving them for the long-term requires a distinct set of strategies. Digital preservation involves ensuring that your files, associated metadata, and repository systems remain accessible and intact over time.

## Routine Maintenance

Regular maintenance is critical to ensure the integrity of your digital content:

* **File checking**: Regularly verify the accuracy and completeness of your digital files.
* **Backups**: Create and store multiple copies of your data in secure locations to prevent loss in case of system failure or disaster.
* **System updates**: Keep your repository systems, software, and hardware up-to-date with the latest security patches and software updates.

## Lossless Copies

To ensure that your digital content remains accessible for years to come, it’s essential to store high-resolution, lossless copies:

* **Originals vs. derivatives**: Store original files in their native format, rather than converting them to a lower resolution or different file type.
* **Multiple formats**: Consider storing multiple versions of your digital content in different formats (e.g., TIFF and JPEG) to ensure that they remain accessible even if one format becomes obsolete.

## Preservation Partnerships

Collaborate with other institutions, organizations, or experts to enhance your preservation efforts:

* **Digital preservation communities**: Participate in online forums, working groups, and conferences to stay informed about best practices and emerging trends.
* **Consultations**: Seek advice from experienced professionals on digital preservation strategies and technologies.

# “Can We Do More?”

In her [article](https://www.clir.org/can-we-do-more/), Carol Mandel emphasizes the importance of acknowledging the limitations of our current digital preservation efforts:

* **Awareness of gaps**: Recognize that even with the best intentions, our current approaches may not be sufficient to ensure long-term preservation.
* **Investigating alternatives**: Consider exploring new technologies and strategies to address these gaps.

## Digital Preservation Skills Maintenance

To effectively preserve your digital content, it’s essential to maintain and update your skills:

* **Training and professional development**: Participate in workshops, conferences, and online courses to stay current with best practices and emerging trends.
* **Collaboration and knowledge-sharing**: Engage with colleagues and experts to share knowledge, experiences, and lessons learned.

By implementing these digital preservation strategies and maintaining your skills, you can ensure that your digital content remains safe and accessible for years to come.

## Questions to Answer: 

* Who will be responsible for preserving and sustaining access to the digital files you will create, and what resources will they use to do this? 
* What level of digital preservation can your organization realistically commit to? 
* Does your organization have access to partners or consortial resources that can be helpful in implementing your digital preservation plan (e.g. keeping copies of your digital content at another, geographically distant, location)?

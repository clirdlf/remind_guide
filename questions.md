## Pre-Project Considerations: Essential Questions for a Successful Digitization and Safeguarding Initiative

Before embarking on a local or regional project to digitize and safeguard threatened cultural heritage, it is crucial to carefully consider the following essential questions. These queries will help ensure that your initiative is well-planned, effective, and respectful of the communities and cultures involved. By thoughtfully addressing these questions, you can minimize potential risks, maximize benefits, and ultimately contribute meaningfully to the preservation of threatened culture.

### Community Engagement

* Who are the primary stakeholders and community members involved in the threatened cultural heritage?
* What are their expectations, concerns, and priorities regarding digitization and safeguarding?
* Have we established meaningful relationships with these communities, or will this initiative be a first-time engagement?
* How will we ensure that the project is inclusive of diverse perspectives and voices?

### Cultural Context

* What is the significance and cultural value of the threatened cultural heritage to be digitized?
* Are there any sensitive or sacred aspects of the culture that require special consideration?
* Have we consulted with cultural experts, elders, or other respected community members regarding the project’s approach?
* How will we address potential controversies or disputes related to ownership, representation, or interpretation?

### Technical Feasibility

* What are the technical requirements for digitizing and preserving the threatened cultural heritage (e.g., equipment, software, storage)?
* Have we assessed the condition and fragility of the materials to be digitized?
* How will we ensure data integrity and quality throughout the digitization process?
* Are there any necessary permits or permissions required for the project?

### Project Scope

* What specific aspects of the threatened cultural heritage are to be digitized (e.g., objects, documents, performances)?
* How much material can realistically be processed within the projected timeframe and budget?
* Will this initiative be a one-time effort or part of an ongoing program?
* Are there any plans for future collaboration or follow-up projects?

### Collaboration and Partnerships

* Who are potential partners, collaborators, or stakeholders that should be involved in the project?
* Have we established clear communication channels and roles within these partnerships?
* How will we ensure coordination and alignment with other initiatives or projects in the region?
* Are there any plans for capacity building, training, or knowledge sharing within these partnerships?

### Governance and Sustainability

* What is the governance structure of the project, including decision-making processes and accountability?
* How will the project be sustained over time, including funding and resource commitments?
* Have we developed a plan for future development and growth, if necessary?
* Are there any mechanisms in place for evaluating the project’s effectiveness and making adjustments as needed?

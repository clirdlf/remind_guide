**Workflows for Digitizing and Safeguarding Threatened Cultural Heritage**

Here are some example workflows that can be used to digitize and safeguard threatened cultural heritage:

### **Pre-Digitization Workflow**

* **Assessment**: Evaluate the condition, fragility, and sensitivity of the materials to be digitized
* **Documentation**: Record metadata about the materials, including provenance, ownership, and context
* **Planning**: Develop a plan for digitization, including the type of scanning or imaging technology to use
* **Preparation**: Prepare the materials for digitization by cleaning, stabilizing, or conserving them as needed

### **Digitization Workflow**

* **Scanning/Imaging**: Use high-resolution scanning or imaging technology to capture detailed images of the materials
* **Image Processing**: Apply image processing techniques to enhance the quality and clarity of the images
* **Metadata Capture**: Record metadata about each image, including technical information and contextual data
* **Quality Control**: Review the digitized images for quality and accuracy

### **Post-Digitization Workflow**

* **Storage**: Store the digitized images in a secure and accessible location, such as a digital asset management system or cloud storage
* **Backup**: Create backups of the digitized images to prevent loss or damage
* **Metadata Management**: Organize and maintain metadata about the digitized materials, including updates and revisions
* **Dissemination**: Share the digitized images with stakeholders, including the public, researchers, and community members

### **Metadata Standards and Best Practices**

* **Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI)**: Use standardized metadata schema to describe digital artifacts
* **Collection management software**: Utilize collection management software to organize and track digitized collections
* **Taxonomy and ontology tools**: Apply taxonomy and ontology techniques to categorize and connect related concepts
* **Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques**: Use NLP to extract and analyze metadata from unstructured data

### **Collaboration and Access**

* **Online platforms and portals**: Share digitized content with the public through online platforms and portals
* **Institutional repositories**: Store and disseminate research outputs through institutional repositories
* **Social media and online communities**: Engage with stakeholders and promote cultural heritage initiatives through social media and online communities
* **Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR)**: Utilize VR and AR technologies for immersive experiences and interactive storytelling

These workflows can be adapted and combined to suit the specific needs and goals of your digitization and safeguarding initiative.

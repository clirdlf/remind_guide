Digitization workflows unfold in a more-or-less predictable series of activities, depending upon the selected materials. By mapping out each step of your project, you’ll be able to identify what you need and ensure that your digitization efforts are efficient and effective.

## Pros and Cons of Grant-Funded Digitization

If your organization is receiving grant funding for digitization, you may have certain expectations and requirements to meet. Some benefits of grant-funded digitization include:

* Access to additional resources (financial, human, or technological) that can enhance your project’s scope and impact
* Potential for long-term preservation and access to digitized materials
* Opportunities for collaboration with other organizations or stakeholders

However, there are also potential drawbacks to consider:

* Strict guidelines and requirements set by the grantor may limit your flexibility and creativity
* Additional reporting and administrative burdens may be imposed on your organization
* Funding may be time-limited, requiring you to prioritize activities and allocate resources accordingly

## Questions to answer

How large is the collection? How old are the materials? Where are they kept, and what is their current condition? Are there any conservation or stabilization measures you would need to take in order to prepare the materials for digitization? How will you describe the materials (i.e. metadata)? What will be the outcomes of your effort? How will we know the project is a success?

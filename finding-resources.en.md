Once you have laid out your project activities step-by-step, it’s essential to identify the resources you’ll need to make it all happen. This includes:

* Space: Where will you store and process the materials?
* Supplies: What equipment, software, and other materials are required for digitization?
* Equipment: Do you need specialized hardware or software to capture and process the content?
* Personnel: Who will perform the scanning, data entry, and quality control tasks?
* Funding: How will you cover the costs of personnel, equipment, and supplies?

## Pros and Cons of Vendor vs. DIY Digitization

When it comes to digitizing materials, you have two main options: vendor-digitization or do-it-yourself (DIY) digitization.

**Vendor-Digitization**: Outsourcing the digitization process to a third-party provider can be beneficial in terms of:
* Expertise: Vendors have specialized knowledge and equipment for specific types of digitization.
* Scalability: Vendors can handle large volumes of materials, freeing up your staff for other tasks.
* Cost-Effectiveness: Vendors often provide a flat fee or per-item pricing, which can be more cost-effective than in-house processing.

**DIY Digitization**: Handling the digitization process in-house can be beneficial in terms of:
* Control: You maintain complete control over the quality and speed of the digitization process.
* Cost-Effective for Small Volumes: If you have a small volume of materials, DIY digitization might be more cost-effective than outsourcing.

## Pros and Cons of Grant Funding

If you’re considering applying for grant funding to support your digitization project, here are some pros and cons to consider:

**Pros**:
* Access to additional resources (financial, human, or technological) that can enhance your project’s scope and impact.
* Potential for long-term preservation and access to digitized materials.

**Cons**:
* Strict guidelines and requirements set by the grantor may limit your flexibility and creativity.
* Additional reporting and administrative burdens may be imposed on your organization.

## Making the Case to Leadership

When making the case to leadership, it’s essential to:

* Clearly articulate the project’s goals, objectives, and expected outcomes.
* Provide a detailed breakdown of costs, timelines, and resource requirements.
* Highlight the benefits of digitization, such as improved accessibility, preservation, and research value.

## Estimating Time and Costs

To accurately estimate time and costs, consider the following:

* Break down the project into manageable tasks and estimate the time required for each.
* Research and compare prices for equipment, software, and personnel services.
* Factor in contingencies and potential delays to ensure a realistic timeline and budget.

## Low-Cost Equipment

When it comes to low-cost equipment options, consider the following:

* Second-hand or refurbished scanners and cameras can be purchased at significantly lower costs than new equipment.
* Open-source software alternatives can provide similar functionality to proprietary software without the high price tag.
* Repurpose existing equipment or materials to minimize waste and reduce costs.

## Questions to answer

* What space, supplies, technologies, personnel, training and outside assistance are needed? 
* Would it be better to outsource some or all of the capture and description work? 
* Can permanent employees do the work or will we need a term worker? 
* What new systems or training must be implemented, and how long will it take to complete this? 
* Who is available to manage the project? 
* Approximately how long will it take to capture, describe, and ingest the files? 
* Who can verify the quality of the work? How much digital storage will be needed to both preserve and provide access to these deliverables?
* How will your organization set aside funds in its normal operating budget to care for your digital cultural heritage? 
* Will training be needed only at the beginning of the project or on an ongoing basis? 
* What free training materials could you use? 
* Does your organization belong to any professional association or networks that could either provide training or provide references to good sources of training?
